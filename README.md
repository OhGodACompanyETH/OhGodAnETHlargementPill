ED (Ethereum Dysfunction) affects 1 in 10 NVIDIA GPUs in North America. But don't worry - OhGodACompany is here to help.

OhGodAnETHlargementPill (Tablet for mining GTX 1080, GTX 1080 Ti) is released only for GDDR5X memory. 
This tablet is intended for users of Nvidia video cards based on GDDR5X video memory (GTX 1080 and GTX 1080 Ti) and significantly increases the hashrate when mining cryptocurrencies using the Ethash algorithm (Dagger Hashimoto).  The software is available for both Linux and Windows, and all you need to do to increase the hashrate of Ethereum (ETH) or other Ethash-based cryptocurrencies up to 50 MHS on GTX 1080 Ti (up to 40 MHs on GTX 1080) is run it along with your miner.


## DOSEAGE INSTRUCTIONS

1. Unpack your pill (.zip on Windows, .gz on Linux);
2. Run OhGodAnETHlargementPill (requires administrative rights on Windows, and root as Linux);
3. Watch your hanging hashrate harden.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

+ Does your ETHlargement not work as expected? You're likely running an older memory revision. Here at OhGodACompany, we believe in promotiong a healthy mining lifestyle - that's why we've got a solution for our senior users, too!
+ With the use of --revA, you can specify which device should be fed our senior solution. If, for example, GPU 0, 3 and 4 aren't the young studs you thought they were, feed them with the following commands:

```
Windows: OhGodAnETHlargementPill.exe --revA 0,3,4

Powershell: .\OhGodAnETHlargementPill.exe --revA 0,3,4

Linux: ./OhGodAnETHlargementPill --revA 0,3,4
```
Be sure to leave ETHlargement running in the background, so your NVIDIA noodle can *aldente*.
